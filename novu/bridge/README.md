# Novu Bridge App

This is a [Novu](https://novu.co/) bridge application bootstrapped with [`npx novu init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/novu)

## Getting Started

To run the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

By default, the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) server will start and your state can be synchronized with Novu Cloud via the Bridge Endpoint (default is `/api/novu`). Your server will by default run on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
