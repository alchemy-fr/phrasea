# Introduction

Phrasea is a Digital Asset Management (DAM) solution developed by Alchemy, a French publisher based in Paris and a DAM expert since the early 90s. Designed as the evolution of Phraseanet (launched in 2005), Phrasea is a robust, modern and complete DAM solution, entirely rewritten to address the current challenges of managing digital media.

Open Source, it is a sovereign alternative to proprietary platforms, guaranteeing transparency and independence.

API-first, and highly scalable, Phrasea is available in SaaS, On-premise, and hybrid modes.

It offers everything you expect from a DAM: import with or without pre-indexing, reading asset metadata sources, manual or automatic indexing, workflow management, collaboration and sharing tools, web publishing, and advanced rights management. It is particularly well-suited for communication and marketing teams, public institutions and communities, media and photographers, and IT departments.
