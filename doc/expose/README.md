# Expose service

Expose service is part of the Alchemy ecosystem.
Its role is to expose assets to the Internet.

Service wraps the following end projects:
- Expose API (back end)

## How it works

Please first have a look at [publication payload reference](./api/README.md)!

First entrypoint is the React app with one main route:

`/p/{id}` (or maybe with a token: `/p/{id}/{token}`)

The React app displays a loader while querying the expose API to fetch the publication:

`GET [API_HOST]/p/{id}`

If there is no protection, the response will contain all the publication payload.
Otherwise the response will be limited to protection method:
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "securityMethod": "password | authentication"
}
```

Then front (React) application will display the according authentication method and request the publication payload again:

- with password: `GET [API_HOST]/p/{id} --header "Authorization: Password {password}"`

In this example we access the publication at:
`https://client-url.com/gallery/123`

### Sequence

![Sequence](doc/sequence.png "Request sequence")

​```sequence
title Expose loading

note over Browser: User wants to access the publication
Browser->React: GET https://expose.com/123
React->Browser: Return static page with JS
note over Browser: React app boots
Browser->API: GET https://api.expose.com/publications/123
API->Browser: Returns publication payload `{"id": "123", ...}`
note over Browser: React displays the layout
​```

## Definitions

At the top level, we have *layouts*:
- download (display thumbnail while downloading the whole package)
- gallery (simple web gallery)
- lightbox (an extended web gallery with actions on files)

At the second level, we have *themes*.
Themes are declined graphical versions of layouts.
A theme should be implemented for each layout.

## Direct URL access

We can define a unique URL path for an asset:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "assetId": "asset-unique-id",
  "alternateUrl": "a/b/c"
}
```

Asset will be accessible at `https://client-url.com/direct/{alternateUrl}`.


## Setup

Override environment variables defined in `.env` file:

```bash
DEV_MODE=false
EXPOSE_CLIENT_ID=<THE_CLIENT_ID>
```

## Analytics

```json
// configs/config.json
{
  "expose": {
    "analytics": {
      "provider": "google_analytics|matomo",
      "options": {
        "propertyId": "GA123", // google_analytics
        "siteId": "4242" // For matomo
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Direct URL access

Publications and assets can be accessed directly with slugs:

e.g. `GET https://mygallery.com/publication-1/asset-1`

In the above example, publication should have a `slug` property equal to `publication-1` and the asset having
