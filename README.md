# Phrasea services

Welcome to the mono-repository of Phrasea micro-services!
This repository contains all the services to facilitate development but each group of services can be deployed alone.

## Setup

- [Installation guide](./doc/setup.md)

## Development

- [Setup guide for development](./doc/dev.md) (requires [setup](./doc/setup.md) first)

## RabbitMQ Management

Access `https://rabbitmq-console.phrasea.local`

## Running multiple instances of services

You may need to deploy to different expose services (with their specific network/security rules).
In that case, you need to assign a unique `APP_ID` to each instance. This `APP_ID` will be stored in report service.
